（初见、自我介绍）
Ah, you must be the new Tarnished.
You'd do well to steer clear of Agheel Lake, 
fledgling. A dragon roosts there...
And it's as fearsome as it it majestic.</text>

<text>
（血指战斗中）
If it isn't Nerijus, The Bloody Finger. 
The end is nigh. For you, and your cessblood.</text>

<text>
（血指战后）
Ah, we meet again. To have fought Nerijus and lived, 
you must have seen your share of battle.
I am Yura, as you might recall, hunter of Bloody Fingers.
Tarnished held in thrall by cessblood. Zealots 
who stalk their own. If you stay the path, 
you are certain to face more of them. Just remember,
no kinship with their ilk remains. 
Their madness precludes it. 
Don't let your emotions stay your blade.</text>

I must not die...
until she is eradicated...</text>

（其他）
Be on your way. 
Perhaps we will meet again, 
if fate permits.</text>
