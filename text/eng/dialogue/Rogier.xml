Ah, nice to meet you.
The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name.A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.
I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle.
When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.
But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil castle?
This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know.
They sacrifice our kind, for grafting.
Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind...</text>
