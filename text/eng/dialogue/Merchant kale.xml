（初见）
You are a Tarnished, I can see it. 
And I can also see... 
That you're not after my throat.
Then why not purchase a little something? 
I am Kale, Purveyor of fine goods.
I am of a nomadic people. 
Selling wares as I travel.
The land has been tainted by madness 
since the shattering of the Elden Ring.
It's only Tarnished like yourself who
keep things from drying up entirely.
Let's say you're a very welcome customer.</text>

（第二次对话）
You know, if you can spare the runes,
you should buy yourself a crafting kit.
A crafting kit allows you to make basic
items on your own. Essential really,
if you intend to survive out here for any duration.
The kit costs a bundle, and I admit,
I do take my cut.
But the important thing is that you survive.
Every customer counts, after all.</text>

（第三次对话）
There are other of my peoples who
yet survive in these lands.
If the mood takes you when you meet one,
then offer them some trade, won't you?
My people, wanderers all,
have long been spurned by the grace of gold.
Which is why we cannot settle,but instead
are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey.
But thanks to that, things are not so different
for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered.
I think this makes us kindred spirits of
sorts Your people, the Tarnished, and mine.
Perhaps you don't need to hear this,
but... See that no harm comes to my kin.
We have a saying, we wanderers.
Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy.
No regard. Nothing.
But if anyone dares harm us, show them no mercy.
That is our code, so to speak.
Just the way we are. Deeply... unforgiving.</text>

Wait, weren't you? Well, you're back... 
Care to buy something?
What is it? Still going to purchase something?
Good-bye, for now.</text>
