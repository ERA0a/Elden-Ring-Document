（初见）
Oh yes... Tarnished, are we?
Come to the Lands Between for the Elden Ring, hmm?
Oh course you have. No shame in it.
But I'm afraid you're plumb out of luck.
You are maidenless. A bit player,
fully divorced from the strength of runes...
Fell free to go off and die in a ditch somewhere....</text>

<text>
（第二次对话）
Oh, can't seem to wrap your head around your predicament?
It's no surprise. You poor have-nots are a stubborn lot.
Fine, then.
If you must have a go at it, maidenless as you are,
you'll require an education.
On the ways of the enlightened Tarnished.
Are you familiar with grace?
The rays of gold that give life to you Tarnished.
You may also behold its golden dust
pointing in a particular direction at times.
That is the guidance of grace.
The path that a Tarnished must travel.
It's nothing short of a miracle.
That the guidance of grace can lead you,
maidenless as you are, to the perfect
place to die in obscurity.</text>

<text>
（第三次对话）
Guidance will show the way, most certainly.
To castle Stormveil, over on the cliff.
The home of the decrepit demigod, Godrick the Grafted.
Although I'm afraid you'll never make it that far, hmm.
Rest assured, I sympathise, deeply.
There's no worse fate than to be maidenless.
Oh, but if, by chance, you do find your way to the castle,
you may receive a summons.
To the famed Roundtable Hold...</text>

（第四次对话）
What's the matter?
Shouldn't you be off proving yourself, or some such?
Then go on, take the hint and follow the guidance of grace.
To castle Stormveil, on the cliff.
And if, by chance you do find your way to the castle,
you may receive a summons.
To the famed Rountable Hold...</text>
