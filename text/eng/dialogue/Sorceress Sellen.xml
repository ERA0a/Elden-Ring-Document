（初见、自我介绍）
Tarnished, are we? 
A wonder you should turn up here.
I am Sellen, a sorcerer, quite plainly,
Why are you here?</text>

<text>
（I want to learn glintstone sorcery）（智力不足）
Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries?
I dare say your proclivities are far from ideal... 
Oh well, perhaps nurture will defy nature,
with a bit of luck.
But one must choose one's masters wisely.
I was exiled from the Academy of Raya Lucaria
as a reviled, apostate witch. 
Do you still wish to learn from me?</text>

Ahh, a yen for glintstone sorceries?
Well, your aptitude does appear...passable.
But one must choose one's masters wisely.

<text>
(laughs)
Well, you are a piece of work.
Very well. You are now my protégé 
in glintstone sorcery.
But I refuse to coddle. 
Or cast kind words. Never.
Anticipate grievances, young apprentice.</text>

（继续对话）
Young apprentice, first things first.
You are a tadpole when it comes to magic.
Infantile. Without the legs to walk.
So, to become a sorcerer, 
first, you must face your ignorance.
Now, shall we start learning?</text>

（学习魔法——增加对话选项“导论”）
Our are draws upon the powers embedded in glintstone,
but what is the nature of such power?
Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos,
golden amber contains the renmants of ancient 
life and houses its vitality,
while Glintstone contains residual life.
And thus, the vitality of the stars.
It should not be forgotten that glintstone sorcery 
is the study of the stars and the life therein.
A fact lost on most sorcerers, these days...</text>

（第二次学习）
Your appetite for learning is impressive.
You make me proud. To have grown little legs so readily.
You must have a fabulous teacher.</text>

<text>
（其他）
There you are, my apprentice. 
Shall we commence the lesson?
All done? Well, be on your way then.</text>
